,2222,Planet Wise and Portion Control,,http://www.hotpinkmomma.com/?p=333,I feel like even though P90xis a large part of my life right now that I still want to focus on weight watchers separately. For me staying on plan plays a huge role in my success. So I thought itd be fun to start a weight watchers favourite of the week. And heres the first one  These are just going to be short blogs about anything related to my weight watchers journey. Foods I love products I love and tricks that work  Ok so for me my favourite snack of choice is cheddar rice crackers. I could seriously eat the whole package in one sitting. So to avoid that Ive been portioning out what I want to eat into planet wise snack bags ahead of time. This way I know exactly how many points Im eating and Im not tempted to eat the whole pack.        There are severalreasons whyI use my planet wise bag instead of a Ziploc bag or a plate   its reusable  its portable  its a great size for snacking  FDA food safe material  PVC BPA Phthalate Latex and Lead Free  you can put anything in it apples crackers cereal etc  and its super cute         My planet wise bag was actually a free gift with a cloth diaper purchase I made. But they retail for around 8. They also come in all sorts of sizes and cute prints.  Weight loss and dieting is challenging and can be somewhat boring at times. I look for things like this to spice up my meals         Pin It    Tweet       Share this  Share   Facebook  Google 1  Twitter  Pinterest  Email,,www.hotpinkmomma.com

,2222,P90X Diary Weeks 1 and 2,,http://www.hotpinkmomma.com/?p=300,Yay Week 2 of P90x complete And it feels amazing. I thought Id start some what of a diary of how Im doing and feeling as the weeks go on. What Im finding challenging and things I want to work on. I think it will be neat to look back on and helpful if I ever decide to do the program again.  So getting started besides buying or borrowing the P90X DVDs heres a list of everything else you may need   an area to workout 6 by 6 min.  TV and DVD player  set of free weights personalised to your strength level  a pull up bar or resistance bands  a chair  a mat is recommended   Next is TIME. Probably the most important and most difficult thing to plan for. However its essential to know when you plan to do the workouts in order to set yourself up for success. Ive chosen nap time. Im usually guaranteed at least one hour during the day when both kids are sleeping. If I dont get my full workout done in the time I finish it when my wonderful husband gets home from work  Alright now onto the workouts. Here is a breakdown of how Ive been doing with the workouts in the first 2 weeks as well as an idea of what they are like.    Core Synergistics  1 Hour   lots of push upsI modified with mostly girl push ups  great all over body workout  Most challenging move Dreya Roll   Cardio X  45 min   Usually I run but it rained really hard week 2 so I tried it out  A combination of the cardio portions of the following workouts yoga plyometrics kenpo and core  Love that it mixes it up constantly no repetitive moves  Worked up a great sweat by the end   ShoulderArms  1 Hour   circuit of shoulder bicep and tricep  new moves each time which is nice  intensity depends on the weight you choose  I need to start tracking next week my weightreps to see if I can improve from week to week   Ab Ripper X  16min twice a week   intense  definitely something that will improve over time  Most challenging move V Sit Up   Legs and Back  1 Hour   lots of pullups and squats  Im using the resistance band instead of pullups at this point  Hardest Move  One legged wall squat   Kenpo  1 Hour   amazing  full of cardio  lots of kicking and punching   Obviously this is just my personal perception of the workouts and their most difficult areas. It may be completely different for you And Im sure my view on these workoutswill evolve as the weeks go on and as I improve. But this is how I felt during the first 2 weeks of P90X. I challenged myself it was super hard work but it was well worth it because I feel amazing I cant wait to see what the next 2 weeks bring.

,2222,P90X Lean Schedule Modified,,http://www.hotpinkmomma.com/?p=252,So as you can tell by the title I bit the bullet and started P90X  After weighing the pros and cons in my last blog I decided I had nothing to lose. I decided to do a test run this past week to make sure I felt it was an attainable goal before I shared the fact that I started with everyone else. And I happy to say it went awesome  Ok so it was definetly extremely hard work.Im not going to sugar coat it  It was tough And I wasnt able to do all the exercises. But considering its a 3 month long program I think that gives me more than enough time to work up to it. Im actually really proud by how much I can do. Dont get me wrong Im not at the pull up level yet but I think I did pretty damn good this past week And it feels amazing  Before I started the first workout I even got my husband to take some BEFORE pictures of mein a twopiece bathing suit gasp. Eww. Do you know how awful that is Haha. The only thing that can make you feel good about seeing your before pictures is if you have the AFTER pictures. Im really looking forward to the after because the before is not so pretty.  Ok so for those of you who were curious about what schedule Im following and the modifications Ive made here is my workout chart      Day 1  Day 2  Day 3  Day 4  Day 5  Day 6  Day 7    P90X Lean Phase 1    Week 13  Core Synergistics  Cardio X Running  ShouldersArms Ab Ripper X  Yoga X  LegsBack Ab Ripper X  Kenpo X  Rest or X Strech    Week 4  Yoga X  Core Synergistics  Kenpo X  X Strech  Cardio X Running  Yoga X  Rest or X Strech    P90X Lean Phase 2    Week 57  Core Synergistics  Cardio X Running  ChestShoulders Ab Ripper X  Yoga X  LegsBack Ab Ripper X  Kenpo X  Rest or X Strech    Week 8  Yoga X  Core Synergistics  Kenpo X  X Strech  Cardio X Running  Yoga X  Rest or X Strech    P90X Lean Phase 3    Week 911  ChestBack Ab Ripper X  Cardio X Running  ShouldersArms Ab Ripper X  Yoga X  Core Synergistics  Kenpo X  Rest or X Strech    Week 1012  ChestShoulders Ab Ripper X  Cardio X Running  BackBiceps Ab Ripper X  Yoga X  Core Synergistics  Kenpo X  Rest or X Strech    Week 13  Yoga X  Core Synergistics  Kenpo X  Yoga X  Cardio X Running  Yoga X  Rest or X Strech     I basically just replaced the cardio x sessions with a 5K run. I really enjoy running and wanted to keep it up so I figured it was a fair trade off.  I really hope this internal drive and motivation that Ive got going on keeps up. I dont like to start things I cant complete. So if it kills me I WILL do this And I hope my results are worth the effort        Pin It    Tweet       Share this  Share   Facebook  Google 1  Twitter  Pinterest  Email,,www.hotpinkmomma.com

,2222,Naptime vs. P90X,,http://www.hotpinkmomma.com/?p=182,I started my weight loss journey 8 weeks ago and up to this point its consisted of weight watchers the elliptical and running. This combination has been working really well for me BUTI feel I need more. And its not even that Im plateauing because I havent yet yay. The p90x bug has gotten in my head and I cant shake it.    It all started with watching Kailins conclusion video of her p90x success story  httpwww.youtube.comwatchvbzkCNOAlln8 . I remember watching her do her weekly p90x videos thinking you go girl but thats something Ill never do. Granted I was pregnant at the time however it just seemed really intense. And now here I stand a year later contemplating it and shes the one who is pregnant Funny how that works..    So shes my inspiration for sure. But before I can commit to something so intense I really want to be sure that Im setting myself up for success. Im so worried that Ill start something and fail. Huge fear of mine Also the main reason why we delayed uploading the weightloss videos in the beginning. Not thats there anything terribly wrong with failing but I always try to be realistic with my goals to avoid disappointment. PLUSsince I share most of my life online failing publicly would be no fun at all.    For those of you who dont know what p90x is all about here is a brief synopsis   Its a multiple dvd workout program  1 to 1.5 Hours a day  6 days a week  13 weeks long  Pretty intense     So as you can see its a pretty big time commitment. Not something to consider lightly. Its a very intense 3 months in a row. Ok 3 months so if I start in January that takes me to the end of March. Well turns out thats actually the last 3 months I have on maternity leave. Maybe its meant to be Or maybe Ill regret devoting so much of my last remaining free time to it    Free time  FREE TIME    Dont you have 2 small children    Haha yes I do Which is a very time consuming and rewarding responsibility. The only free time and feasible time I can see to commit to this program is.NAP TIME. I obviously cant do an hour workout program while they are awake and when my husband gets home we are busy with dinner and baths and well life. And by the time they are in bed Im too exhausted. Sooo that leaves naptime. The one and only almost guaranteed time to myself I have during the day. Usually spanning between 100230pm.    I feel extremely fortunate that I am able to get this me time in a day. The fact that I can line up the naptimes of 2 small children is an accomplishment in itself. I usually eat lunch edit videos write blogs and RELAX in this time. Am I really prepared to give it up     Pros  Cons      P90x will help boost my weightloss  I will increase my strengthendurance  I will be extremely proud of myself  Iwillfeel great headingback to work  Iwill know Im working as hard as I can to lose the weight      I may feel more tiredstressed out because I lost naptime  I mightput too much pressure on myself  Less time to vlog and blog       Theres a lot to think about here but as it stands this moment I am leaning towards doing it. Since you guys know Ill share the journey with you onYouTubeand here as well I guess youll find out soon whether or not I do        Pin It    Tweet       Share this  Share   Facebook  Google 1  Twitter  Pinterest  Email,,www.hotpinkmomma.com

2013/06/03,,Social Media and Taksim Square Protests inTurkey,,http://adamacar.wordpress.com/2013/06/03/social-media-and-taksim-square-protests-in-turkey/,Tags gezi  geziparki  social movements  taksim  taksimsquare  Turkey  Turkish    Yesterday Turkish prime minister RecepTayyipErdogan stated that Twitter was a big trouble of Turkey . He may have a point as at least two major newspapers also reported that there were a number ofbaseless rumors circulating on Twitter that may have played a major role in the escalation of the events. Below is the list of some of those rumors  Turkish police used agent orange very dangerous checmicalgas this was retweeted on Twitter at least 3000 times . The picture that was retweetedonly shows one holding a can no proof that this was used by the police.  A protester named Kerem killed by police. This was retweeted 332 times and by now it is clear that it was a different person who died of a heart attack.  There were tweets that 40000 people were crossing the Bosphorus Bridge but the photo seemed to have been taken during last years marathon.  src   These are quotedfrom Todayszaman  One such photo was postedby Birgndaily columnist EceTemelkuran. The photo showed the police using pepper spray against demonstrators from a close distance. Temelkuranposted the photo as if it was taken in Turkey but it was actually from Boston.  Another misleading piece of information in social media were rumors that Turkeys Constitutional Court would overthrow the government if the demonstrations last for more than 48 hours but there is no such a law in Turkey.  There were also claims that the police used Agent Orange against protesters which was not true. The use of Agent Orange is banned by the United Nations as it considers it a chemical weapon.  A tweet allegedly posted by Health Minister MehmetMezzinolusaying You oppose the state and the police and then expect an ambulance to show up was also found to be fake.  A photo showing a policemanusing pepper spray against a dog also turned out to bean act of manipulation on social media as the photo was from Italy not stanbul.  What Happened  The prime minister and his party proposed to turn one of the public parks partially into a culture center and alsorebuild a historical military barrack as a museum. There were concerns that people close to the ruling party were to have financial gains from this project. The protests started 7 days ago and in the past 3 days turned violent. According to the govt. hundreds of vehicles and shops were damagedand vandalized while the number ofdemonstrators and security forces who were hospitalizedreported to bein the hundreds. Yesterday the prime minister admitted that the police forces used excessive force.The public park and the vicinity where most of the demonstrations and clashes took place currently are open.  During the events more than 2 million tweets related with the demonstrations were posted on Twitter.  Cultural Implications  After reading the news I wanted to compare the rumors in Istanbul with the ones that got circulated around during the occupy wall street protests OWS as both of the events seemed somewhat similar. To my great surprise the only two false news that got retweeted thousands of times during OWS were Radioheads concert and Batmans appearance in the protests that turned to behoax despite the scale of the event there were more than 700 arrests and the demonstrations lasted for weeks . Of course no two social movements can be compared head to head but it made me wonder why in Istanbul there were at least half a dozen false rumors produced and hundreds of times retweeted just in 2 days while there was pretty much nothing in NYC.  Media censure and media coverage  Some people may blame the lack of media coverage as the main reason for these hoaxes. Simply put having no information by credible journalists makes it way easier for provocateurs to spread false news. While major news channels like CNN and BBC frequently informed the public about OWS CNN Turk and NTV the two major news channels in Turkey chose not to broadcast the demonstrations in Istanbul.  One should also remember that Turkey ranks as one of the worst countries in the world according to the Press Freedom Index . Some protesters also attacked vehicles and buildings owned by media organs because of this reason . However theres another side of the story.  Even if all of the media channels broadcasted the demonstrations live all of those hoaxes and anger against the mainstream media would perhaps still be around because the Turks in general have a love level of social trust anyways. According to Edelmans trust barometer Turkish people in general dont trust the govt. business media and NGOs. slide 6. So it would be too naiveto presume that all the hoaxes circulated because of the lack of media coverage given the fact that all of themajor newspapers both right and left wing gave the news on their front pages for the past few days. please click on arsiv  Social media adoption and social media usage  Turkey is known to be a very Facebook Friendly country . As the matter of fact according to Comscore Turkey has the 4th highest social media engagement scoreavg. time spent for social media after Israel Argentina and Russia. Turkey is the 6th largest country represented on Facebook even though the country has a relatively low internet penetration rate. Twitter also seems to be making some inroads in Turkey. Turkish is the 5th most popular language on Twitter and there are more than a dozen Twitter accounts in Turkey followed by more than 1 million people. Obviously Turkish people like social media.  Are there differencebetween how Turkish people use social media and the way social media used in different parts of the world Recently we are conducting a study to answer a similar question what role culture plays when it comes to social media usage We showed the following pictures to people from different parts of the world and asked them to indicatethe likelhood that they would like the post on Facebook or not. Then we correlated the individuals country scores on different cultural dimensions and post likeability.    We found that people coming from countries that have clear social hierarchies e.g. Turkey  are more likely to share images that aim to raise awareness about humanitarian issues 2    We also asked the respondents how comfortable they would feel sharing the following type of info on Facebook. The results show that people from collectivistic and masculine societies e.g. Turkey are more likely to share political messages on Facebook.    Communication style  I couldnt find any particular resource on Turkish communication style but this paper about Arab communication style can bequite insightful how people communicate over there. Although as a Turkish citizen I can list one million differences between Arabs and Turks there are some similarities in the way these two nations communicate. After all they are geographically close have similar religious beliefs and politically and culturally influenced one another e.g. the Ottomans used the Arabic alphabet and a significant number of words used by the Ottoman had Arabic origins. The article compares and contrasts the Arabs and Americans in the way they use persuasive language  1. Repetition vs. simplicity Americans prefer simplicity and Arabs prefer repetition  2. Accuracy vs. imagery Americans prefer accuracy and Arabs prefer imagery  3. Exaggeration vs. understatement Americans prefer understatements Arabs exaggerate  4. Words vs. action Americans prefer action Arabs verbal statements are powerful among Arabs  5. Vague vs. specific Americans are specific and direct while Arabs prefer vague statements  if we presume that Arabic and Turkish communication styles are somewhat similar then we can presume that there are likely to bemore hoaxes on Twitter consciously or subconsciously produced by Turkish Twitter users. Especially 3 exaggeration is a clear indicationthat any event on Twitter can easily be turned into a hoax after a few quoted retweets.  More on exaggeration and vagueness in Turkish culture  Today there were news in the mainstream media about the social media rumors that sparked the events. However even these news stories were exaggerated. For instance according to Star Gazetesi there were tweets saying that 500 demonstrators were killed however when I searched on Twitter  there was only 1 tweet like this.  TurkiyeGazetesi claimed that there were tweets that said we all will be killed by this govt. but once again I couldnt find any similar tweet.Another one was posted on Milliyets website Turkeys one of the top 3 newspapers claiming that agent orange was real because there were pictures in social media.  Diverse opinions and hoaxes on Twitter  A recent study showed that hoaxes are more likely to spread if people do not look for different opinions and different resources. According to the paper theres already homophilypeople friedning similar people and polarization on Twitter which makes it easy for people to accept false news. The paper also reports that the best way to control the spread of misinformation is getting news from diverse resources. However Turkey because of many reasons is not necessarily a pluralist or multiculturalist society. This naturally means it is more difficult for Turkish people to detect false news.  Connecting the dots  Given the fact that people from collectivistic and high powerdistance societies tend to share political messages more and compared with Western cultures people from the middle east tend use more vague language we may expect more Twitter hoaxes especially in the middle east.  A reminder about human psychology  I personallythink TaksimSquareGeziparki events were mostly caused by police brutality which may have indirectly caused Los Angeles Riots London Riots the Arab Spring and etc. The police as amateur and as wild they were also may have acted irrationally because of various reasons that we may not know. Besides studies show that all human beings may act very aggressively based on the context or selflessly obey orders from their superiors.  Disclaimer  Some of the analyses above are qualitative in nature  Turkey is a candidate member of the EU it does not have exactly the same communication culture with the Arabs  Occupy Wall Street and GeziParkimay not bedirrectly compared because the events are different in terms of  number of hoaxes vs number of hoaxes retweeted  number of hoaxestotal number of tweets  total number of tweetsnumber of twitter users in the country  number of affected people  number of incidences that involve violence  Number of tweets within vs. outside the country  and so on   About these ads   Share this  Share   Twitter  Google  LinkedIn  StumbleUpon  Email  Facebook    Like this Like Loading...

It makes sense to presume that if more people post political messages the possibility of passing on a political message that is baseless increases.  One automatically may claim that there should have been more hoaxes and rumors during the Tahrir Square demonstrations compared to those in Turkey and obviously there were not many. However readers should note that during the Tahrir Square demonstrations 70 of the messages in social media Twitter to be more specific were posted by users from different countries whereas in the recent Gezi Parki protests 90 of the messages were posted by Turkish users .,,adamacar.wordpress.com

2011/02/27,,Is Twitter bigger thanFacebook,,http://adamacar.wordpress.com/2011/02/27/twitter-is-bigger-than-facebook/,Tags facebook  social networks  twitter    This of course depends on how you measure it  Social Media experts are convinced that Facebook is the future of marketing future of the internet and the future of well everything Although this might be partly true If you ask the academicians they clearly prefer Twitter over Facebook  Take the figure below which shows the number of academic papers published about Facebook and twitter in the last 3 years. Twitter caught up to Facebook in 2009 and last year there were more academic papers published about Twitter than Facebook. A potential impact of Twitter can be attributed to its easiness to use by academicians unlike facebook which involves tons of privacy issues. Regardless these numbers suggest that there are and will be many contenders against FBs hegemony in the realm of OSNs.FYI there are more than 3000 articles published about Facebook and Twitter.

2011/03/02,,What can Facebook teach us about KansaiCulture,,http://adamacar.wordpress.com/2011/03/02/what-can-facebook-teach-us-about-kansai-culture/,Many of you might automatically think about the size of the social networks as people in Kansai are known to be friendlier thus might have larger friend networks This calls for another study but it seems like one of the major differences is adoption of innovation.  Despite the fact that Facebook is one of the hottest topics in the media especially after the interface change and a recent Hollywood movie people in Kansai dont seem to much care about this site. As can be seen in these google insights graphs Osakans search for prices post office and maps where Facebook tops Tokyoites search list in the last 90 days. Another pattern emerges from these figures is the tendency to search in romaji versus Kanji     About these ads   Share this  Share   Twitter  Google  LinkedIn  StumbleUpon  Email  Facebook    Like this Like Loading...

2012/08/05,,Why Japan has FewerStartups,,http://adamacar.wordpress.com/2012/08/05/why-there-arent-many-start-ups-in-japan/,Good Old Days  A study by Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2003 has shown that Japan has the lowest entrepreneurship activity among the 37 countries that were surveyed. I was wondering about the reason and after reading some past studies in the area I discovered that the best predictor of the entrepreneurial activity is population growth. This makes sense because if there are more people a there are more opportunities b theres low job security and low social security and c there are more people to compete against in order to survive. Then we might assume that developed countries usually have low entrepreneurship rates because theres low population growth.However Japan has a higher birthrate than other developed Asian countries like Singapore and Korea but scores lower in the entrepreneurship index.  As the matter of fact Japan has a number of characteristics that make it a very suitable country for entrepreneurs such as   Low tax rate compared with the US or the EU  High work ethic and masculinity culture work is important growth is essential etc.  Educated workforce  High integration with the rest of the world compared with other large Asian South American or African countries  Low crime rate and low piracy rate   Why then are there fewer startups in Japan   Japan scores lowest of all countries in regards to risktaking behavior according to the World Value Survey 20052008. Starting a company with a few people on a small budget is taking a huge risk.    Japan is a collective society and in collective societies theres low need for individual selfachievement. If you dont have a strong desire for selffulfillment or being very influential or very rich you wouldnt want to start a company.    Japan has high powerdistance in society. This makes things very hard for young entrepreneurs when dealing with suppliers creditors and even employees. Additionally this makes decision making harder and longer.    Japanese people have a low internal locus of control belief that outside factors government city big corporations etc. can change things but individuals cant.    In Japan the best job is thought to be the most secure job not the best paying job. Thats why the majority of students even today just want to get a lifetime job regardless of the job itself.    In Japan one of the worst things is disappointing others. If you found a startup and if it fails you will take others down with you.    In Japan the most important thing is majime suru. That is how you are doing one thing is as important as if not more important than the result itself. This is against the startup philosophy. In startups you have to achieve many things with a small workforce with a small amount of money and in a very short time. Because of these constraints many things have to be mecha kucha incomplete imperfect and this is against majime suru or the idea that process is more important than the result.    In Japan companies want to do business with big organizations with long history just to be safe. That is if a few young techie guys go to a company and say Hey we have this new web application and we will give it to you for free no company will talk to them because they are very young they have no capital and their company has no history. Thats why in Japan companies list how much paid capital and the head count they have on their websites.    Japanese culture has long time orientation. That is from a Western point of view its normal that a small company can grow exponentially 100 this year and 1000 next year. If a company grows this fast in Japan e.g. 10 folds every year people would think its very unhealthy. What is worse a startup which is trying to reach a global audience or grow 510 folds a year might be seen very aggressive in Japan.   Startups need to move very fast. You can find these kinds of quotes on the walls of Facebook move fast break things or done is better than perfect. But to a Japanese person these things dont make much sense. If you move fast and if you dont check what you are doing you will be disrespected in Japan. More importantly Japanese people want to do things perfectly its better to wait and do it right in the first place rather than trial and error.     Japan has the lowest social network usage in the world as a result of smaller social circles usually ones circle is limited to coworkers and high school friends where in the West people have larger circles. Smaller friend circle means smaller social capital that means its harder for Japanese to find individuals to collaborate with.   As it can be seen most of these are related with risk avoidance and long term orientation. However risk avoidance and long term orientation are not necessarily bad things. As the matter of fact they represent the Japan Inc. philosophy which created high quality and durable products in the 70s 80s and 90s that ruled the world. We just have to teach kids that sometimes taking risks has more merits than demerits. And this surely is possible. Many Japanese universities are pushing study abroad programs that strengthen students ability to adjust to new environments. There are many intercultural and international events happening at Japanese universities that promote dealing with ambiguities and uncertainties. While you are reading this perhaps one or two startup events are taking place in Tokyo. Times are surely changing. The question is can Japan change before its too late  originally posted in Japanese on StartupDating httpwww.startupdating.com20120410reasonswhytherearentmanystartupsinjapan   About these ads   Share this  Share   Twitter  Google  LinkedIn  StumbleUpon  Email  Facebook    Like this Like Loading...

2012/08/15,,What Makes Mixi different thanFacebook,,http://adamacar.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/what-makes-mixi-different-than-facebook/,The history of modern social networks in Japan goes back to December 2003 when the online profile based dating site Gocoo was introduced Takahashi 2010. mixi was established in 2004 Barkeramp Ota 2011 and quickly gained traction to became the leading social network destination in Japan with more than 15 million monthly users  mixi . However mixi is not as popular as it used to be as Facebook has increasing its userbase and currently there are more Twitter users than mixi Users Thomson amp Ito 2012. Additionally a recent ComScore 2012 report claimed that Facebook has a higher number of monthly unique visitors than does mixi.  Despite being challenged by its foreign competitors mixi still has a strong presence in Japan and is seen as more secure and convenient by local users Acar et al. 2012. Almost all of the past studies that compared and contrasted mixi with other social networks concluded that mixi is easier for the Japanese to use because it is simply a reflection of the Japanese culture Fogg amp Iizawa 2011 Acar et al. 2012. It consists of smaller and tightly knit social circles and promotes anonymity long term commitment and indirect communication which are part of the Japanese culture. By the same token mixi users also tend to be introspective and conservative when presenting themselves on the network See Table 1.  Table 1 Past academic studies which compared and contrasted mixi and Western social networks      Study    mixi    Facebook amp Myspace      Barker amp Ota 2011   Users tend to be conservative and introspective. Users try not to offend friends by writing something different the feeling of sameness.  Users tend to be bold assertive open.    Only 20 use their real names.  Most of the users 87 user real names..    84 used the diary function.  Only 4 used the platform to write a diary.    Only 21 posted a picture of themselves.  77 posted a picture of self.    Avg. of 7080 friends.  Avg. of 100150 friends.    57 restrict access to close friends.  Only 37 does so.    Main user motive is social identity gratification.  Main user motives are communicating with close friends social compensation entertainment and passing time.     Fogg amp Iizawa 2008   Platform is not designed to make friends. Getting to know others takes time.  Quick and direct forms of communication. Communication messages that require direct action poking chatting.    Interface is subtle and indirect.  Interface is assertive and mechanistic.     Acar 2012   Users consider it to be safer.  Users report security problems spam.     Takahashi 2010   About me with them.  About me and them.     Thomson amp Ito 2012    Only 11 showed their real name and real profile picture.  59 of Japanese users showed their real name and real profile picture.    Lower selfdisclosure homogeneous contacts smaller number of contacts highcommitment relationships. This is a reflection of a low level of social mobility in Japan.  Higher selfdisclosure heterogeneous contacts higher number of contacts lowcommitment relationships.     Important Note A recent mixi survey indicates that the percentage of real friends friends with whom the users met facetoface was 81.5 for mixi 60.3 for Facebook and 48 for Twitter. httppr.mixi.co.jp20110601infographics.html   About these ads   Share this  Share   Twitter  Google  LinkedIn  StumbleUpon  Email  Facebook    Like this Like Loading...
