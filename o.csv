2013/06/03,2222,Social Media and Taksim Square Protests inTurkey,,http://adamacar.wordpress.com/2013/06/03/social-media-and-taksim-square-protests-in-turkey/,Tags gezi  geziparki  social movements  taksim  taksimsquare  Turkey  Turkish    Yesterday Turkish prime minister RecepTayyipErdogan stated that Twitter was a big trouble of Turkey . He may have a point as at least two major newspapers also reported that there were a number ofbaseless rumors circulating on Twitter that may have played a major role in the escalation of the events. Below is the list of some of those rumors  Turkish police used agent orange very dangerous checmicalgas this was retweeted on Twitter at least 3000 times . The picture that was retweetedonly shows one holding a can no proof that this was used by the police.  A protester named Kerem killed by police. This was retweeted 332 times and by now it is clear that it was a different person who died of a heart attack.  There were tweets that 40000 people were crossing the Bosphorus Bridge but the photo seemed to have been taken during last years marathon.  src   These are quotedfrom Todayszaman  One such photo was postedby Birgndaily columnist EceTemelkuran. The photo showed the police using pepper spray against demonstrators from a close distance. Temelkuranposted the photo as if it was taken in Turkey but it was actually from Boston.  Another misleading piece of information in social media were rumors that Turkeys Constitutional Court would overthrow the government if the demonstrations last for more than 48 hours but there is no such a law in Turkey.  There were also claims that the police used Agent Orange against protesters which was not true. The use of Agent Orange is banned by the United Nations as it considers it a chemical weapon.  A tweet allegedly posted by Health Minister MehmetMezzinolusaying You oppose the state and the police and then expect an ambulance to show up was also found to be fake.  A photo showing a policemanusing pepper spray against a dog also turned out to bean act of manipulation on social media as the photo was from Italy not stanbul.  What Happened  The prime minister and his party proposed to turn one of the public parks partially into a culture center and alsorebuild a historical military barrack as a museum. There were concerns that people close to the ruling party were to have financial gains from this project. The protests started 7 days ago and in the past 3 days turned violent. According to the govt. hundreds of vehicles and shops were damagedand vandalized while the number ofdemonstrators and security forces who were hospitalizedreported to bein the hundreds. Yesterday the prime minister admitted that the police forces used excessive force.The public park and the vicinity where most of the demonstrations and clashes took place currently are open.  During the events more than 2 million tweets related with the demonstrations were posted on Twitter.  Cultural Implications  After reading the news I wanted to compare the rumors in Istanbul with the ones that got circulated around during the occupy wall street protests OWS as both of the events seemed somewhat similar. To my great surprise the only two false news that got retweeted thousands of times during OWS were Radioheads concert and Batmans appearance in the protests that turned to behoax despite the scale of the event there were more than 700 arrests and the demonstrations lasted for weeks . Of course no two social movements can be compared head to head but it made me wonder why in Istanbul there were at least half a dozen false rumors produced and hundreds of times retweeted just in 2 days while there was pretty much nothing in NYC.  Media censure and media coverage  Some people may blame the lack of media coverage as the main reason for these hoaxes. Simply put having no information by credible journalists makes it way easier for provocateurs to spread false news. While major news channels like CNN and BBC frequently informed the public about OWS CNN Turk and NTV the two major news channels in Turkey chose not to broadcast the demonstrations in Istanbul.  One should also remember that Turkey ranks as one of the worst countries in the world according to the Press Freedom Index . Some protesters also attacked vehicles and buildings owned by media organs because of this reason . However theres another side of the story.  Even if all of the media channels broadcasted the demonstrations live all of those hoaxes and anger against the mainstream media would perhaps still be around because the Turks in general have a love level of social trust anyways. According to Edelmans trust barometer Turkish people in general dont trust the govt. business media and NGOs. slide 6. So it would be too naiveto presume that all the hoaxes circulated because of the lack of media coverage given the fact that all of themajor newspapers both right and left wing gave the news on their front pages for the past few days. please click on arsiv  Social media adoption and social media usage  Turkey is known to be a very Facebook Friendly country . As the matter of fact according to Comscore Turkey has the 4th highest social media engagement scoreavg. time spent for social media after Israel Argentina and Russia. Turkey is the 6th largest country represented on Facebook even though the country has a relatively low internet penetration rate. Twitter also seems to be making some inroads in Turkey. Turkish is the 5th most popular language on Twitter and there are more than a dozen Twitter accounts in Turkey followed by more than 1 million people. Obviously Turkish people like social media.  Are there differencebetween how Turkish people use social media and the way social media used in different parts of the world Recently we are conducting a study to answer a similar question what role culture plays when it comes to social media usage We showed the following pictures to people from different parts of the world and asked them to indicatethe likelhood that they would like the post on Facebook or not. Then we correlated the individuals country scores on different cultural dimensions and post likeability.    We found that people coming from countries that have clear social hierarchies e.g. Turkey  are more likely to share images that aim to raise awareness about humanitarian issues 2    We also asked the respondents how comfortable they would feel sharing the following type of info on Facebook. The results show that people from collectivistic and masculine societies e.g. Turkey are more likely to share political messages on Facebook.    Communication style  I couldnt find any particular resource on Turkish communication style but this paper about Arab communication style can bequite insightful how people communicate over there. Although as a Turkish citizen I can list one million differences between Arabs and Turks there are some similarities in the way these two nations communicate. After all they are geographically close have similar religious beliefs and politically and culturally influenced one another e.g. the Ottomans used the Arabic alphabet and a significant number of words used by the Ottoman had Arabic origins. The article compares and contrasts the Arabs and Americans in the way they use persuasive language  1. Repetition vs. simplicity Americans prefer simplicity and Arabs prefer repetition  2. Accuracy vs. imagery Americans prefer accuracy and Arabs prefer imagery  3. Exaggeration vs. understatement Americans prefer understatements Arabs exaggerate  4. Words vs. action Americans prefer action Arabs verbal statements are powerful among Arabs  5. Vague vs. specific Americans are specific and direct while Arabs prefer vague statements  if we presume that Arabic and Turkish communication styles are somewhat similar then we can presume that there are likely to bemore hoaxes on Twitter consciously or subconsciously produced by Turkish Twitter users. Especially 3 exaggeration is a clear indicationthat any event on Twitter can easily be turned into a hoax after a few quoted retweets.  More on exaggeration and vagueness in Turkish culture  Today there were news in the mainstream media about the social media rumors that sparked the events. However even these news stories were exaggerated. For instance according to Star Gazetesi there were tweets saying that 500 demonstrators were killed however when I searched on Twitter  there was only 1 tweet like this.  TurkiyeGazetesi claimed that there were tweets that said we all will be killed by this govt. but once again I couldnt find any similar tweet.Another one was posted on Milliyets website Turkeys one of the top 3 newspapers claiming that agent orange was real because there were pictures in social media.  Diverse opinions and hoaxes on Twitter  A recent study showed that hoaxes are more likely to spread if people do not look for different opinions and different resources. According to the paper theres already homophilypeople friedning similar people and polarization on Twitter which makes it easy for people to accept false news. The paper also reports that the best way to control the spread of misinformation is getting news from diverse resources. However Turkey because of many reasons is not necessarily a pluralist or multiculturalist society. This naturally means it is more difficult for Turkish people to detect false news.  Connecting the dots  Given the fact that people from collectivistic and high powerdistance societies tend to share political messages more and compared with Western cultures people from the middle east tend use more vague language we may expect more Twitter hoaxes especially in the middle east.  A reminder about human psychology  I personallythink TaksimSquareGeziparki events were mostly caused by police brutality which may have indirectly caused Los Angeles Riots London Riots the Arab Spring and etc. The police as amateur and as wild they were also may have acted irrationally because of various reasons that we may not know. Besides studies show that all human beings may act very aggressively based on the context or selflessly obey orders from their superiors.  Disclaimer  Some of the analyses above are qualitative in nature  Turkey is a candidate member of the EU it does not have exactly the same communication culture with the Arabs  Occupy Wall Street and GeziParkimay not bedirrectly compared because the events are different in terms of  number of hoaxes vs number of hoaxes retweeted  number of hoaxestotal number of tweets  total number of tweetsnumber of twitter users in the country  number of affected people  number of incidences that involve violence  Number of tweets within vs. outside the country  and so on   About these ads   Share this  Share   Twitter  Google  LinkedIn  StumbleUpon  Email  Facebook    Like this Like Loading...

Jun 2013,2222,Tag Archives,,http://adamacar.wordpress.com/tag/occupy-wall-street/,Tags antigovernemnt  brasil  brazil  gezi parki  occupy wall street  police  taksim square  the arab spring  twitter    Of course no social movement can be similar.That is why sociologists cannot run social experiments in their labs. However saying that there was nothing in common between the Occupy Wall Street Occupy Moscow the Arab Spring Taksim Gezi Parki and Brazilian antigovernment protests would be a little naive. Apparently social media played a significant role in all of these events.  Simply put  1 Most of these events started as peaceful demonstrations  2 In most of these events the police interfered by using force  3 In most of these events the police interference helped protesters gain a domestic and worldwide support  4 There were many similar events in all of these countries in the past as well the police presumably used unjustified force to disperse protesters in many occasions not only in the past 3 years.  One difference is social media hoaxes that circulated mostly in Turkey but not in the other countries. In my previous blog post I talked about some potential explanations including the tendency of using social media for social changes in certain societies. This Washington Post news also confirms this view tha t people in the middle east are 2 times more likely to post political and community related messages compared to those in Brazil. It makes sense to presume that if more people post political messages the possibility of passing on a political message that is baseless increases.  One automatically may claim that there should have been more hoaxes and rumors during the Tahrir Square demonstrations compared to those in Turkey and obviously there were not many. However readers should note that during the Tahrir Square demonstrations 70 of the messages in social media Twitter to be more specific were posted by users from different countries whereas in the recent Gezi Parki protests 90 of the messages were posted by Turkish users .,,adamacar.wordpress.com

Twitter caught up to Facebook in 2009 and last year there were more academic papers published about Twitter than Facebook. A potential impact of Twitter can be attributed to its easiness to use by academicians unlike facebook which involves tons of privacy issues. Regardless these numbers suggest that there are and will be many contenders against FBs hegemony in the realm of OSNs.FYI there are more than 3000 articles published about Facebook and Twitter.

Softbank one of the popular telecommunications company in Japan was the most followed brand with 52 444 followers proceeded by Ajinomoto 29370 followers. Although the investigation of Facebook pages is beyond the scope of this paper we also searched for the brand pages of the companies on Facebook to check if the twitter account was listed there. Facebook usage was almost nonexistent among the top 100 as we only found 2 brand pages on facebook.com.  Since the number of active Japanese companies was rather small in our first sample we assessed the top 30 most active Japanese companies separately in the second phase of the analysis. Readers should note that not all of the 30 companies we investigated were among the Nikkei Top 100 list. Based on our analysis the most frequent commercial tweet category in Japan is promotions 52 followed by dialogues 43 and news 13 See Graph I.    A further analysis of hashtags  and  signs indicated that Japanese companies do not shy away from initiating or maintaining direct conversations with their followers as a quarter of the messages were directed at individual users  signs. Hashtags which function as chat sessions were also quite common See Graph II.    This study was completed by March 9th 2011.  Top 100 Corporations list was obtained fromhttpmarkets.nikkei.co.jprankingkeieiuriage.aspx   About these ads   Share this  Share   Twitter  Google  LinkedIn  StumbleUpon  Email  Facebook    Like this Like Loading...

2012/08/15,2222,What Makes Mixi different thanFacebook,,http://adamacar.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/what-makes-mixi-different-than-facebook/,The history of modern social networks in Japan goes back to December 2003 when the online profile based dating site Gocoo was introduced Takahashi 2010. mixi was established in 2004 Barkeramp Ota 2011 and quickly gained traction to became the leading social network destination in Japan with more than 15 million monthly users  mixi . However mixi is not as popular as it used to be as Facebook has increasing its userbase and currently there are more Twitter users than mixi Users Thomson amp Ito 2012. Additionally a recent ComScore 2012 report claimed that Facebook has a higher number of monthly unique visitors than does mixi.  Despite being challenged by its foreign competitors mixi still has a strong presence in Japan and is seen as more secure and convenient by local users Acar et al. 2012. Almost all of the past studies that compared and contrasted mixi with other social networks concluded that mixi is easier for the Japanese to use because it is simply a reflection of the Japanese culture Fogg amp Iizawa 2011 Acar et al. 2012. It consists of smaller and tightly knit social circles and promotes anonymity long term commitment and indirect communication which are part of the Japanese culture. By the same token mixi users also tend to be introspective and conservative when presenting themselves on the network See Table 1.  Table 1 Past academic studies which compared and contrasted mixi and Western social networks      Study    mixi    Facebook amp Myspace      Barker amp Ota 2011   Users tend to be conservative and introspective. Users try not to offend friends by writing something different the feeling of sameness.  Users tend to be bold assertive open.    Only 20 use their real names.  Most of the users 87 user real names..    84 used the diary function.  Only 4 used the platform to write a diary.    Only 21 posted a picture of themselves.  77 posted a picture of self.    Avg. of 7080 friends.  Avg. of 100150 friends.    57 restrict access to close friends.  Only 37 does so.    Main user motive is social identity gratification.  Main user motives are communicating with close friends social compensation entertainment and passing time.     Fogg amp Iizawa 2008   Platform is not designed to make friends. Getting to know others takes time.  Quick and direct forms of communication. Communication messages that require direct action poking chatting.    Interface is subtle and indirect.  Interface is assertive and mechanistic.     Acar 2012   Users consider it to be safer.  Users report security problems spam.     Takahashi 2010   About me with them.  About me and them.     Thomson amp Ito 2012    Only 11 showed their real name and real profile picture.  59 of Japanese users showed their real name and real profile picture.    Lower selfdisclosure homogeneous contacts smaller number of contacts highcommitment relationships. This is a reflection of a low level of social mobility in Japan.  Higher selfdisclosure heterogeneous contacts higher number of contacts lowcommitment relationships.     Important Note A recent mixi survey indicates that the percentage of real friends friends with whom the users met facetoface was 81.5 for mixi 60.3 for Facebook and 48 for Twitter. httppr.mixi.co.jp20110601infographics.html   About these ads   Share this  Share   Twitter  Google  LinkedIn  StumbleUpon  Email  Facebook    Like this Like Loading...

2012/03/31,2222,Is Facebook getting popular due to theearthquake,,http://adamacar.wordpress.com/2012/03/31/is-facebook-getting-popular-due-to-the-earthquake/,Tags earthquake  facebook  Japan  social media  social media japan earthqukae  tohoku earthquake    No. Google Insights clearly shows that although Facebook is getting more and more popular in Japan the earthquake almost had no impact at least in the short run on its growth. On the other hand Twitter and UStream saw a sharp traffic spike right after the quake.    Furthermore when the quake hit about 98 of the population in the Tohoku area was not on Facebook while even some of the local governments were using Twitter. Many people reported as saved by Twitter theres no evidence that someone was saved after the quake because heshe found help on Facebook. httpadamacar.wordpress.com20110318lasttweetbeforethetsunamihit  More on the Japanese social media scene httpasiajin.comblog20120402asummaryofthelateststudiesaboutjapansocialmedia   About these ads   Share this  Share   Twitter  Google  LinkedIn  StumbleUpon  Email  Facebook    Like this Like Loading...

2012/08/05,2222,Why Japan has FewerStartups,,http://adamacar.wordpress.com/2012/08/05/why-there-arent-many-start-ups-in-japan/,Good Old Days  A study by Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2003 has shown that Japan has the lowest entrepreneurship activity among the 37 countries that were surveyed. I was wondering about the reason and after reading some past studies in the area I discovered that the best predictor of the entrepreneurial activity is population growth. This makes sense because if there are more people a there are more opportunities b theres low job security and low social security and c there are more people to compete against in order to survive. Then we might assume that developed countries usually have low entrepreneurship rates because theres low population growth.However Japan has a higher birthrate than other developed Asian countries like Singapore and Korea but scores lower in the entrepreneurship index.  As the matter of fact Japan has a number of characteristics that make it a very suitable country for entrepreneurs such as   Low tax rate compared with the US or the EU  High work ethic and masculinity culture work is important growth is essential etc.  Educated workforce  High integration with the rest of the world compared with other large Asian South American or African countries  Low crime rate and low piracy rate   Why then are there fewer startups in Japan   Japan scores lowest of all countries in regards to risktaking behavior according to the World Value Survey 20052008. Starting a company with a few people on a small budget is taking a huge risk.    Japan is a collective society and in collective societies theres low need for individual selfachievement. If you dont have a strong desire for selffulfillment or being very influential or very rich you wouldnt want to start a company.    Japan has high powerdistance in society. This makes things very hard for young entrepreneurs when dealing with suppliers creditors and even employees. Additionally this makes decision making harder and longer.    Japanese people have a low internal locus of control belief that outside factors government city big corporations etc. can change things but individuals cant.    In Japan the best job is thought to be the most secure job not the best paying job. Thats why the majority of students even today just want to get a lifetime job regardless of the job itself.    In Japan one of the worst things is disappointing others. If you found a startup and if it fails you will take others down with you.    In Japan the most important thing is majime suru. That is how you are doing one thing is as important as if not more important than the result itself. This is against the startup philosophy. In startups you have to achieve many things with a small workforce with a small amount of money and in a very short time. Because of these constraints many things have to be mecha kucha incomplete imperfect and this is against majime suru or the idea that process is more important than the result.    In Japan companies want to do business with big organizations with long history just to be safe. That is if a few young techie guys go to a company and say Hey we have this new web application and we will give it to you for free no company will talk to them because they are very young they have no capital and their company has no history. Thats why in Japan companies list how much paid capital and the head count they have on their websites.    Japanese culture has long time orientation. That is from a Western point of view its normal that a small company can grow exponentially 100 this year and 1000 next year. If a company grows this fast in Japan e.g. 10 folds every year people would think its very unhealthy. What is worse a startup which is trying to reach a global audience or grow 510 folds a year might be seen very aggressive in Japan.   Startups need to move very fast. You can find these kinds of quotes on the walls of Facebook move fast break things or done is better than perfect. But to a Japanese person these things dont make much sense. If you move fast and if you dont check what you are doing you will be disrespected in Japan. More importantly Japanese people want to do things perfectly its better to wait and do it right in the first place rather than trial and error.     Japan has the lowest social network usage in the world as a result of smaller social circles usually ones circle is limited to coworkers and high school friends where in the West people have larger circles. Smaller friend circle means smaller social capital that means its harder for Japanese to find individuals to collaborate with.   As it can be seen most of these are related with risk avoidance and long term orientation. However risk avoidance and long term orientation are not necessarily bad things. As the matter of fact they represent the Japan Inc. philosophy which created high quality and durable products in the 70s 80s and 90s that ruled the world. We just have to teach kids that sometimes taking risks has more merits than demerits. And this surely is possible. Many Japanese universities are pushing study abroad programs that strengthen students ability to adjust to new environments. There are many intercultural and international events happening at Japanese universities that promote dealing with ambiguities and uncertainties. While you are reading this perhaps one or two startup events are taking place in Tokyo. Times are surely changing. The question is can Japan change before its too late  originally posted in Japanese on StartupDating httpwww.startupdating.com20120410reasonswhytherearentmanystartupsinjapan   About these ads   Share this  Share   Twitter  Google  LinkedIn  StumbleUpon  Email  Facebook    Like this Like Loading...

This is an online version of one of CUPs best seller English Grammar in Use . I would recommend it to all of my students for several reasons 1 Incredibly high quality visuals 2 Very appealing and easy to navigate through user interface 3 A large number of exercises after each topic 4 Exercises are also available in audio format this is very important 5 Simple explanations about engaging topics for instance the book had a very nice explanation of the grammar differences between American and British English  .  I had a chance to review Japanese for Kids by Dino Lingo . This is a set of 5 DVDs  flash cards and two posters. Our daughter really liked the videos and danced to the music as the videos include lots of upbeat songs. I would recommend the set to parents with young children because 1 The videos are fun and engaging 2 There are many repetitions. Repetition a higher likelihood to retain info 3 The set encourages parent child interaction amp parent monitoring which is a must   About these ads   Share this  Share   Twitter  Google  LinkedIn  StumbleUpon  Email  Facebook    Like this Like Loading...

2011/04/07,2222,SNS Estimates inJapan,,http://adamacar.wordpress.com/2011/04/07/socialbakers-or-social-fakers/?msg=fail&replytocom=8&shared=email,Recently we have been conducting focus group studies with the college students housewives about facebook usage but most of the people we talk to dont even know what facebook is  We are also working on fb brand pages global analysis. We found out that in Japan the brand with the highest number of fb followers is Miyamatsu Net a marketing company focuses on fb brand page building.Additionally according to Google insights the two most popular fb related search keywords are fb pages and fb fan pages. What is more most of the active fb users in Japan are males while traditionally socialnetworking especially in Japan is associated with females. This automatically raises many questions.  On the other hand above you see the SocialBakers numbers that claim the number of fb users in Japan increased by 20 in 1 day or 500000 more people started using fb in 1 day. Although these numbers might be correct we kindly advise the internet marketers to look for different resources such as Nielsen data to estimate the market growth.

For instance according to Facebooks ad data there are an estimated   180 people who live in Japan exactly 13 years old and younger who are married  1720 people who live in Japan exactly 15 years old and younger who graduated from college  2035120 people who live in Japan and who speak Japanese BUT 624400 who live in Japan and who speak any variety of English 620 of whom prefer speaking Pirate  A few additional explanations  The data first of all are updated roughly fortnightly.  The obvious Some Japanese users with a certain degree of anonymity and are willing to fib on their profiles to attain this.  FB is finally gaining momentum in Japan and either companies are creating dummy accounts to understand better the Facebook ecosystem or are encouraging employees in marketing and other departments to learn by doing.  Given the events in the past month its possible that some around the world have switched to Japan as their locale in order to show solidarity for the nation.  Estimates are exactly that estimates.

2012/04/08,2222,Top Brands Facebook Use in Japan and theUSA,,http://adamacar.wordpress.com/2012/04/08/top-brands-facebook-use-in-japan-and-the-usa/,Tags facebook  Japan    Top Brands Facebook Use in Japan and the USA  FacebookJapanUSA click on this link to view the graphs  About three months ago we started a project aimed to systematically assess the differences between American and Japanese companies based on social media usage. The idea was comparing the activity of major brands on Twitter and Facebook and then pinpointing significant differences between Japan and the USA. We suspected that the impact of culture would be observed in top brands social media posts on both sides of the Atlantic. After all hard selling push marketing dominance in the West vs. soft selling pull marketing in Japan were widely known but no one ever has investigated whether the same pattern existed in social media.  As a first step we analyzed the twitter activity in both countries and the differences were huge. Overall American companies were way more communicative than Japanese companies they posted more messages mentioned users directly actively used hash tags and more frequently engaged with their followers. We then looked at the Facebook pages of the top 100 American and Japanese companies to see if the same result holds true. These are the findings  1 Not there yet Still the majority of the top 100 Japanese brands are not on Facebook yet. Most of the famous Japanese brands such as Hitachi Daikin Isuzu had several Facebook pages in different countries but none in Japan.  2 I dont have any question While half of the US brands asked a question in the past 7 days to their fans this ratio was 13 in Japan. In other words 9 out of 10 Japanese brands did not ask a question to engage their fans during the week where we analyzed the data. This was the most interesting finding by far.  3 Hold it there Another interesting finding we found was the difference in user restrictions in Japan and the USA. The majority of the US brands about 80 allowed their users to post on the walls of their pages whereas only one third of Japanese brands had a wall open for user comments .  4 Shhhh Be quiet Although the difference was rather small we observed that Japanese companies post fewer messages compared to their US counterparts a pattern we also saw on twitter. A quarter of Japanese companies did not post anything in the past 7 days and there was no Japanese brand in the sample that posted more than 20 messages in a week. However it seems like theres consensus in both countries that 47 posts a week is ideal See the graph below.  Our analysis showed that the most active American brands were Youtube WalMart CNN MTV and Forbes. Users should note that four of these companies are media institutions whose frequent posts might be tolerated. There was only 1 American nonmedia brand that posted more than 20 messages a week Wal Mart. The most active Japanese brands were Shiseido 14 postswk Nomura Shoken 15 postswk and JVC 15 postswk. We realized that there was no media company made it to the Japanese top 100 brands listed by MPP.  5 You dont have to contact with me. In this study we also looked at the amount of information provided in the info section of Facebook brand pages to determine whether selfdisclosure differences in Eastern and Western cultures are reflected in the commercial use of Facebook. We saw that American companies had more links on their info pages links to different campaigns company contact page HR PR etc.. Thus we concluded the US companies tend to provide more information and spend more efforts to connect with their fans through different channels.  Conclusion It seems like Japanese companies are not as communicative as their American counterparts on Facebook. We think culture local lifestyles communication styles and media usage habits play a significant role in this difference. For instance the reason most companies dont allow their fans to post on the walls might be stemming from high risk avoidance in Japanese culture. The reason why companies have fewer links on the info sections might have something to do with low selfdisclosure  in the culture. However it should be also noted that Facebook has a low penetration rate in Japan. The fact that companies dont post or dont ask questions frequently on Facebook can be tied to low response rate because of a smaller number of fans a natural result of a smaller percentage of Facebook users in Japan.  Methodology  The data was coded by 3 bilingual Japanese students who were trained incontentanalysis. The coding took place during January 2012. A small subset of the data was coded by all three coders and intercoder reliability was about 83. There was no API or software used in the process it was just manual coding and taking percentages. When searching for brands on Twitter coders alsocheckedfor subbrands e.g. WrigleyStarburst KelloggsPopTarts. Here are the lists of Japanese top 100 Brands and US Top 100 brands. Please note that the sample size for the sns activity graphs above is not 200 because not all companies in the selected sample had a Facebook account.  PS The only 8 US brands that didnt have a Facebook account were  Aetna AIG Colgate Esso Goodyear Marlboro Miller and Viagra.  Please contact with the author to obtain the full data set.

2011/05/18,2222,Twitter Facebook SNS in Japan and MobileInternet,,http://adamacar.wordpress.com/2011/05/18/twitter-facebook-sns-in-japan-and-mobile-internet/,Yesterday we held our first joint study session with the Michigan State University students as a part of our ICC communication course. It was incredibly effective and educational thanks to the extraordinary students from MSU and their teacher Dr. Coursaris. Here are the key takeaways  A very small number of users mostly celebrities are responsible for most of the tweeting activity  Twitter is not neccessarily a social network service but a broacasting tool.  There is no certain underlying driver behind twitter usage everyone has a different reason.  First Japanese SNS was Goco a dating site 2003 followed by Gree Mixi 2004 Myspace 2006 and FB 2008  Gree is the largest SNS 25 million  members Mixi is the most actively used SNS 18 of the internet population Excluding YahoobbMobage aliance  59 of Mixi users are females vs. only 42 female FB users in Japan this is because a naturally it is less costlier for males to share personal information with the public b most fb users in Japan seem to be business oriented people who tend to be males  84 of Mixi subscribers use the diary feature compared to 4 of Facebook users.88 of Facebook users posted music while only 8 of Mixi users did so.  84.3 of Japanese Facebook users reveal their name to people compared to only 20 of mixi users MOBILE MARKETING DATA LABO. 2011.  The most active mobile Internet users are 1219 year old school girls.  75.2 Japanese smart phone users downloaded presumably paid for an application in the past year vs only 43 American users and and 38European users.   By December2010 almost half of Japanese mobile phone users had a smartphone 48  Zynga games seem to dominate top 5 mixi social gamesSunshine ranch Rekoo Farm VilleFriends scorecard SoratobuMake City  My City LifeKaitou royale  Mafia WarsKanji test DRECOM. mixi 2010  51 of Japanese social gamers were females.  Japanese people usually play social games before going to bed lunch time and commuting time.  Mixi is the most popular social gaming platform 45 of social gamers  Recently there was a huge jump in internet usage rates among the elderly 6569  200838 200957.  It is in Japanese culture even in 2002 before this sns boom 80 of the Japanese mentioned that they do not want to use their real name on the net in addition to the 90 who said they feel uncomfortable using their real picture.

2011/03/06,2222,Tweeting inJapan,,http://adamacar.wordpress.com/2011/03/06/tweeting-in-japan%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E4%BA%BA%E3%81%AF%E3%81%84%E3%81%A4%E3%83%84%E3%82%A4%E3%83%83%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B/?msg=fail&replytocom=3&shared=email,It is difficult to find reliable information when it comes to Twitter usage in Japan. Since there was not any public source available that can answer my question I turned to the online searching tools.  My findings were quite similar to the US numbers released by HubSpot in 2009 except a few details. Heres the take away  IN JAPAN   If you want to be retweeted immediately the best time to tweet is Thursday night around 10 PM .  Your tweets have the highest chance of being retweeted if they are sent on Tuesday around 10 PM followed by 2 busy days  You might not want to send out tweets on Saturday that is when the tweeting activity is almost 30 lower than any other day.  The highest numbers of tweets are sent on Tuesday and Thursday. Saturday and Sunday are the slowest days.    Additionally on an average day the number of tweets sent  decreases dramatically after 1 am  starts to pick up around 6 am  shows a steep increase around 1230 during the lunch time   peaks around 10 PM.    Our data presents a somewhat different picture than the US data and it is because there are 4 different time zones in the US with different population density. For instance when people in LA tweet about a popular drama they have just watched on TV  folks in the East Coast would be sleeping.    On the left 2009 Hubspot study. Tracked 5 million Twitter accounts for 6 months in 2009 found to understand when and what time people tweet in the United States.  In both Japanese and the US data Thursdays are the busiest days. In our data we observed the same level of tweeting activity on Tuesday and Thursday we gave the highest ranking to Thursday because a somewhat low level of tweeting activity occurred on the Thursday morning which was used in this data.  Methodology  We identified the most common Japanese words in Japanese language Source NISPET. Then we searched on Google Realtime to check for the hits for each keyword. Since all results were similar we only used the results for . Unfortunately Google Realtime only displays a series of bars where the highest bar represents the highest amount of tweets sent in the data set. We assigned a number to each bar according to its length and then we added up the numbers for each day and for each hour. Finally the numbers were normalized 100 being the top score. February 2127 data was used for weekly analysis and Februrary 21 st data was used for the daily analysis.  These results however should be interpreted with caution because   calculating a value for bar length is not an ideal method   seasonal influences e.g. Valentines Day New Years Golden Week   daily influencese.g. unexpected political developments disasters an intriguing celebrity tweet  the number of tweeters has always been going up not steady  Twitter or the APP users might experience temporary problems etc.   About these ads   Share this  Share   Twitter  Google  LinkedIn  StumbleUpon  Email  Facebook    Like this Like Loading...

Why Well your guess is as good as mine is on that point. But I can tell you for a fact and from data research that Monday nights have traditionally been the worst night for TV including satellite for these last ten years. The viewership on a Monday night is so poor that it is often 5060 of the viewership of a Tuesday night. I got this information as a producer at Music On TV on SkyPerfect TV so the demographic are young people I reckon they are target users for Twitter. Love the blog. Looks great.

2011/06/26,2222,Why Japan is anOutlier,,http://adamacar.wordpress.com/2011/06/26/why-japan-is-an-outlier/,In one of my recent postings Ive mentioned that Japanese OSN users had the lowest number of avg. network members in the world. Similar to this a recent study by Global Web Index shows that Japan has 1 the lowest online social network penetration 2 the lowest percentage of active online social network users 3 the lowest percentage of online group creators.  What is more Japans active online social network users ratio about 15 is miniscule compared with the world average appx. 50 and still way below than the second lowest country South Korea appx. 35   These can be explained by our recent focus group session findings which indicated that Japanese users are concerned of privacy and security. They also tend to stay away from any online behavior that might disrupt social harmony. Japan is closely followed by Korea a geographically and culturally the closest country to Japan  As expected Philippines Malaysia and Indonesia South East Asia are the most social countries which score very high on Hofstedes cultural collectivism dimension.

2011/07/20,2222,Google Reactions from the JapaneseBlogosphere,,http://adamacar.wordpress.com/2011/07/20/google-reactions-from-the-japanese-blogosphere/,Tags Google plus  Google  Google in Japan    The reviews of Google  from the western part of the world seemed to be positive except some mixed messages from one Tech blog . I then asked one of my students to scan major tech blogs in Japan and give me a brief summary. According to what she shared with me it seems like Google  created a very good first impression in the Japanese blogosphere. The comments ranged from the ease of use to sleekness of design from application possibilities to the option of creating different network groups and so on.

2011/07/07,2222,Are Social Media BlogsObjective,,http://adamacar.wordpress.com/2011/07/07/are-social-media-blogs-objective/?shared=email&msg=fail,,,adamacar.wordpress.com
2011/07/20,2222,The Problem with Facebook inJapan,,http://adamacar.wordpress.com/2011/07/20/the-problem-with-facebook-in-japan/,The Japanese online community has always been known to value anonymity . Past research also shows that when compared with Westerners Japanese tend to have a higher fear of negative appraisal and low levels of selfdisclosure.  To explore how Japanese online behavior impacts Facebook adoption we have conducted two focus group sessions with 18 Facebook members who prefer to use the local online social network service Mixi . Our findings indicated that the biggest concern among these users is Facebooks real name policy.  However when asked if they would start using Facebook again if anonymity were allowed most of the participants noted their reluctance because communication in Japanese was more convenient on Mixi.  Methodology  The focus group sessions were held at a public university in Southern Japan on June 1st and June 10th 6 and 12 participants respectively. The study was announced to the students via email where the participation criteria was having an experience of using Facebook in the past but not currently using it. All of the participants were college students majoring in International Relations or English and given an extra class credit for their participation.  Below is the summary of our findings from the focus group sessions  1. Facebook lacks basics in Japan  Studies show that there are four major factors that impact online social network continuance namely   The platform is seen as more secure  The platform has a better user interface  The platform is perceived as more popular  The platform is seen as a good source of information  SourcesMore readings 1  2  and 3   All of our participants agreed that Facebook is less secure has a more complicated user interface and is definitely not popular compared with Mixi their preferred online social network. The users indicated that they prefer Twitter to gather information rather than Mixi or Facebook. Regarding the interface participants evaluated Facebook as open bold and aggressive  but also complicated and not Japanese friendly.  2. Real name policy is a problem but not a huge deal  When asked if they stopped using FB because of its real name policy a majority of the participants said yes. On the other hand when we prompted if they would actively use Facebook if anonymity kamei were allowed most of the respondents seemed reluctant. The respondents stated that Facebook was an international platform. To communicate with their Japanese friends they saw Mixi as just enough citing they see no additional value in Facebook. This is an interesting finding because all of the concerns users expressed about using Facebook were related with the real name policy.  3. The Risks of Using Facebook  a Old friends acquaintances and coworkers can easily find them and ask to be friends. For foreigners it might be easier to just reject the request but this seems very difficult in Japanese culture  b They might make a mistake when posting an update One user mentioned how embarrassed she felt after wrongly posting a happy birthday message in English.  c Whatever they post on their walls might be irrelevant or bothersome to some of the members on the network.Japanese are very concerned about not bothering others Gomewakuo kaku  d Phototagging is an invitation for invasion of privacy. They mentioned their uneasiness to use the tagging function because even if that photo is seen by a friend of a friend it still feels like a stranger is looking at their picture.  e Sponsored stories without users permission is an invasion of privacy.  f Facebook is an open door for spam and pushy marketing practices. Users mentioned that they received a lot of spam and flirty messages from people they did not know. Some users also mentioned that their friends Facebook accounts were hacked and that this never happens on Mixi  4. Additional Reasons why Facebook Goes Against Japanese Culture  These are my personal observations and thoughts  a Japanese culture values harmony remember the first sentence from each international marketing book about Japan the nail that sticks out get hammered down. This makes it difficult to   Switch to Facebook if the majority is not using it  Post forth an honest opinion that criticizes something or someone  Reject a friendship request or delete a member who is not active any more e.g. it would be extremely rude in Japan if a new employee rejects his superiors Facebook friendship request   b Japan has the highest risk avoiding culture. This makes it difficult to   Disclose personal information posts photos videos  event organizing user location. Less sharing means less page views and that means less revenue for Facebook.  Make new friends on online social networks or use online social networks to find a friend rather than maintain friendships.   c There is high power distance in Japan. This makes it difficult to   Share the same messages with senior coworkers younger friends close friends acquaintances and relatives at the same time.   d Japan has a high need for escapism . This makes it difficult to   Communicate on Facebook facing real people real names.   e Japan has a highcontext culture. The Japanese traditionally prefer face to face communication as online conversing might cause more misunderstandings. Although 95 of Japanese ages 1849s had access to the internet in the past 10 years Mixi or any other social network membership has always been about 25. In other words unlike foreigners the Japanese do not have a burning desire to maintain relationships online regardless of their friends geographic proximity.  Other possible indications  a Currently there are about 700 monthly searches for how to quit Facebook  on Google Source Google Adwords. Having 700 of such searches in Japanese isnt too cool especially when we have such a small group of Facebook users.   b Although currently there are about 3.7 million Facebook users in Japan the number of active users is expected to be lower than that   There are two million registered foreigners who live in Japan which means the number of real Japanese on Facebook Japan is WAY lower than 3.7 million.  The Japanese have smaller friend networks and do not share much information which we can assume they do not have to log in as frequently as the U.S counterparts. sourcemore reading 1   Many quitters do not cancel their Facebook account for instance in our study 17 out of 18 users had kept their Facebook accounts even though they always used Mixi and did not like Facebook   Conclusions  It seems clear that Facebook is not likely to pass a 10 user ratio similar to Korea  because of the reasons explained above. However this is still a pretty profitable situation for Facebook as the current 3.4 million Japanese users can bring substantial advertising dollars given that thetotal advertising expenditure is high  in Japan .  Also remember that last year Twitter made about three million dollars in Japan despite its lackluster financial performance in the U.S. On the other hand losing in Japan has some symbolic ramifications since Japan would be the place where the astronomic FB growth would stop just like how the Ottomans stopped in Vienna or Alexander the Great got defeated in Egypt. In both cases the empires started to shrink       About these ads   Share this  Share   Twitter  Google  LinkedIn  StumbleUpon  Email  Facebook    Like this Like Loading...

2011/03/02,2222,What can Facebook teach us about KansaiCulture,,http://adamacar.wordpress.com/2011/03/02/what-can-facebook-teach-us-about-kansai-culture/,Many of you might automatically think about the size of the social networks as people in Kansai are known to be friendlier thus might have larger friend networks This calls for another study but it seems like one of the major differences is adoption of innovation.  Despite the fact that Facebook is one of the hottest topics in the media especially after the interface change and a recent Hollywood movie people in Kansai dont seem to much care about this site. As can be seen in these google insights graphs Osakans search for prices post office and maps where Facebook tops Tokyoites search list in the last 90 days. Another pattern emerges from these figures is the tendency to search in romaji versus Kanji     About these ads   Share this  Share   Twitter  Google  LinkedIn  StumbleUpon  Email  Facebook    Like this Like Loading...

Our initial analysis has shown that fewer Japanese brands are active both on Twitter and Facebook when compared with the top US brands. We also observed that Japanese brands in general ask fewer questions post less frequently dont address their fans directly dont initiate conversations share less amount of information and dont allow fans to post on their Facebook walls. The top 100 American brands investigated in this study seemed to be way more active and assertive compared to the top 100 Japanese brands.

2012/11/11,2222,Yes Its Global Japans first Social Media Focused Contest Kicksoff,,http://adamacar.wordpress.com/2012/11/11/japans-first-social-media-focused-competition-kicks-off/,After successfully holding the 2011 Marketing Competition Japan MCJ in which 24 teams from 12 different universities participated the MCJ committee officially launched MCJ 2012. The organizers of the event expect more than 150 teams from 30 different universities mostly from Global COE institutions in Japan to compete in MCJ 2012.The competition will also hold workshops to train college students on how to prepare a marketing plan in English.  This years theme is increasing human traffic to Kobe Harborland. The participants first have to understand why people travel to Kobe and then come up with effective advertising messages to attract more visitors to Kobe Harborland. To complete their business plan the participants also need to create simple advertisements and explain how they will incorporate social media tools like Twitter Facebook mixi Google etc. into their plans to promote the famous tourist location.  Starting this year MCJ will also accept international applications online. The case for the international students is a little bit different than the case for Japanese students and international students do not have to travel to Japan to present their plans. All of the applications will be submitted online and evaluated by the organizing committee. International students will also focus on the people in their own country e.g. if they live in Singapore they will target the people in Singapore if they are from Thailand they will target the people in Thailand.The award for the best international plan is a 500 cash prize. httpmarketingjp.comglobal Marketing Competition Japan is a taskbased learning activity that allows participants to improve their English skills critical thinking skills and presentation skills by providing an opportunity to work on a real life business case. All plans must include social media and should strategically utilize Twitter YouTube mixi or Facebook etc. to be qualified. It is the first competition that combines English business and social media elements in order to raise globally competent leaders who are equipped with the knowledge of modern communication technologies and business skills.   The Team from the University of Tokyo Who Won the Grand Prize in MCJ 2011  MCJ is organized by the Marketing Competition Japan Committee at Kobe City University of Foreign Studies with support from several widely known corporations and organizations including Nestle PampG NHK mixi Dentsu The Japan Times Cambridge University Press and BBC World News.

It builds up expectation during the fist half. Even though the first half is boring people still watch it because it is not long and it makes the second half more enjoyable e.g. from super slow to super fast    About these ads   Share this  Share   Twitter  Google  LinkedIn  StumbleUpon  Email  Facebook    Like this Like Loading...

Feb 2013,2222,Category Archives,,http://adamacar.wordpress.com/category/marketingjp/,After successfully holding the 2011 Marketing Competition Japan MCJ in which 24 teams from 12 different universities participated the MCJ committee officially launched MCJ 2012. The organizers of the event expect more than 150 teams from 30 different universities mostly from Global COE institutions in Japan to compete in MCJ 2012.The competition will also hold workshops to train college students on how to prepare a marketing plan in English.  This years theme is increasing human traffic to Kobe Harborland. The participants first have to understand why people travel to Kobe and then come up with effective advertising messages to attract more visitors to Kobe Harborland. To complete their business plan the participants also need to create simple advertisements and explain how they will incorporate social media tools like Twitter Facebook mixi Google etc. into their plans to promote the famous tourist location.  Starting this year MCJ will also accept international applications online. The case for the international students is a little bit different than the case for Japanese students and international students do not have to travel to Japan to present their plans. All of the applications will be submitted online and evaluated by the organizing committee. International students will also focus on the people in their own country e.g. if they live in Singapore they will target the people in Singapore if they are from Thailand they will target the people in Thailand.The award for the best international plan is a 500 cash prize. httpmarketingjp.comglobal Marketing Competition Japan is a taskbased learning activity that allows participants to improve their English skills critical thinking skills and presentation skills by providing an opportunity to work on a real life business case. All plans must include social media and should strategically utilize Twitter YouTube mixi or Facebook etc. to be qualified. It is the first competition that combines English business and social media elements in order to raise globally competent leaders who are equipped with the knowledge of modern communication technologies and business skills.   The Team from the University of Tokyo Who Won the Grand Prize in MCJ 2011  MCJ is organized by the Marketing Competition Japan Committee at Kobe City University of Foreign Studies with support from several widely known corporations and organizations including Nestle PampG NHK mixi Dentsu The Japan Times Cambridge University Press and BBC World News.
