They work well as an eye shadow primer base or even as an eye shadow on their own. They do not crease and hold pigment really well. I find they are so versatile Here are the colours I currently own.

Id like to loose 50lbs if possible. How quickly did you loose your weight Were you also doing exercise or other activities I work 40 hours a week and have two older kids who play sports. It seems we are always on the road going to a game or to practice. Fast food has been an easy fix. One that I must break the habit of Anyhow curious how quickly you lost your weight and if you were also doing exercise. You look terrific Thanks for the inspiration. I must get off my tail and drop some pounds            Reply  Quote                   4 written by Allison  1 year ago                                   Hi Melissa  I also have 2 kids so I can totally relate. It took me 7 months to lose the 60 pounds although the first 50 came off within 5 months. Yes I am currently excersing although I started off totally inactive. Its been a gradual process. But Ive known a lot of people who lost their weight with no exercise at all If you are curious step by step of how I got here I recorded a YouTube video every single week of my progess on my channel httpwww.youtube.comallharr . And if you have any more questions or want to chat more feel free to email me at allisonhotpinkmomma.com . I just find it easier to communicate via email.

,2222,Posts tagged,,http://www.hotpinkmomma.com/?tag=p90x-weightloss-naptime,I started my weight loss journey 8 weeks ago and up to this point its consisted of weight watchers the elliptical and running. This combination has been working really well for me BUTI feel I need more. And its not even that Im plateauing because I havent yet yay. The p90x bug has gotten in my head and I cant shake it.    It all started with watching Kailins conclusion video of her p90x success story  httpwww.youtube.comwatchvbzkCNOAlln8 . I remember watching her do her weekly p90x videos thinking you go girl but thats something Ill never do. Granted I was pregnant at the time however it just seemed really intense. And now here I stand a year later contemplating it and shes the one who is pregnant Funny how that works..    So shes my inspiration for sure. But before I can commit to something so intense I really want to be sure that Im setting myself up for success. Im so worried that Ill start something and fail. Huge fear of mine Also the main reason why we delayed uploading the weightloss videos in the beginning. Not thats there anything terribly wrong with failing but I always try to be realistic with my goals to avoid disappointment. PLUSsince I share most of my life online failing publicly would be no fun at all.    For those of you who dont know what p90x is all about here is a brief synopsis   Its a multiple dvd workout program  1 to 1.5 Hours a day  6 days a week  13 weeks long  Pretty intense     So as you can see its a pretty big time commitment. Not something to consider lightly. Its a very intense 3 months in a row. Ok 3 months so if I start in January that takes me to the end of March. Well turns out thats actually the last 3 months I have on maternity leave. Maybe its meant to be Or maybe Ill regret devoting so much of my last remaining free time to it    Free time  FREE TIME    Dont you have 2 small children    Haha yes I do Which is a very time consuming and rewarding responsibility. The only free time and feasible time I can see to commit to this program is.NAP TIME. I obviously cant do an hour workout program while they are awake and when my husband gets home we are busy with dinner and baths and well life. And by the time they are in bed Im too exhausted. Sooo that leaves naptime. The one and only almost guaranteed time to myself I have during the day. Usually spanning between 100230pm.    I feel extremely fortunate that I am able to get this me time in a day. The fact that I can line up the naptimes of 2 small children is an accomplishment in itself. I usually eat lunch edit videos write blogs and RELAX in this time. Am I really prepared to give it up     Pros  Cons      P90x will help boost my weightloss  I will increase my strengthendurance  I will be extremely proud of myself  Iwillfeel great headingback to work  Iwill know Im working as hard as I can to lose the weight      I may feel more tiredstressed out because I lost naptime  I mightput too much pressure on myself  Less time to vlog and blog       Theres a lot to think about here but as it stands this moment I am leaning towards doing it. Since you guys know Ill share the journey with you onYouTubeand here as well I guess youll find out soon whether or not I do        Pin It    Tweet,,www.hotpinkmomma.com
