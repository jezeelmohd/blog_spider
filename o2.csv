I really enjoy making videos and I plan to continue to do so however Ive recently been exposed to this whole blog world. I started by reading a couple of blogs by various YouTube mommies and now I feel like Im starting to figure it out and Im really enjoying it I think this will be a great addition to my YouTube hobby as I love to document our life and share things that are important to me and my family.    Allison Harrison Kayla 2 and Rylie 6 months  So why the name Hot Pink Momma  Well it starts with the fact that I hate my YouTube channel name allharr. Allharr AllisonHarrison. Why wont they let us change our channel names Grr. I created allharr simply to be able to comment on other peoples videos. I was solely a viewer with no intention to create my own videos. Well that all changed obviously. And now Im stuck with it Allharrnot sure how to even pronounce my own channel name Lol.  Anywaysso Ive come to terms that Im stuck with allharr on YouTube. But I got excited knowing I could pick a new blog name. Yay  Ok so heres my explanation behind the name  Hot  Well Im not so hot yet. But Im on a weight loss journey Soo maybe someday  Pink  My favourite colour Plus I have two girlies so I think pinks a given.

These are just foods I find myself turning to inbetween meals or for dessert. So here we go    SALTY SNACKS    Rice crackers 5 points for half the pack  Smart Pop Popcorn 6 points for the whole bag      SAVOURY SNACKS    Laughing cow cheese 1 point each  Turkey bites 1 point each      SWEET SNACKS        Vitatop brownies 3 points each  Fat free pudding 2 points  Cool whip 2 Tbsp 1 point  Skinny Cow Cones 4 points      ZERO POINT SNACKS        Veggies Pickles Fruits and Diet Pop ZERO      I always love coming across new ideas for snacks and new products. So share some of your favourites with me         Pin It    Tweet              httpwww.youtube.comwatchv1IVJiU52J1w       Pin It    Tweet          I feel like even though P90xis a large part of my life right now that I still want to focus on weight watchers separately. For me staying on plan plays a huge role in my success. So I thought itd be fun to start a weight watchers favourite of the week. And heres the first one  These are just going to be short blogs about anything related to my weight watchers journey. Foods I love products I love and tricks that work  Ok so for me my favourite snack of choice is cheddar rice crackers. I could seriously eat the whole package in one sitting. So to avoid that Ive been portioning out what I want to eat into planet wise snack bags ahead of time. This way I know exactly how many points Im eating and Im not tempted to eat the whole pack.        There are severalreasons whyI use my planet wise bag instead of a Ziploc bag or a plate   its reusable  its portable  its a great size for snacking  FDA food safe material  PVC BPA Phthalate Latex and Lead Free  you can put anything in it apples crackers cereal etc  and its super cute         My planet wise bag was actually a free gift with a cloth diaper purchase I made. But they retail for around 8. They also come in all sorts of sizes and cute prints.  Weight loss and dieting is challenging and can be somewhat boring at times. I look for things like this to spice up my meals         Pin It    Tweet              httpwww.youtube.comwatchvlFIJV1dEj8U       Pin It    Tweet,,www.hotpinkmomma.com

So share some of your favourites with me         Pin It    Tweet          Yay Week 2 of P90x complete And it feels amazing. I thought Id start some what of a diary of how Im doing and feeling as the weeks go on. What Im finding challenging and things I want to work on. I think it will be neat to look back on and helpful if I ever decide to do the program again.  So getting started besides buying or borrowing the P90X DVDs heres a list of everything else you may need   an area to workout 6 by 6 min.  TV and DVD player  set of free weights personalised to your strength level  a pull up bar or resistance bands  a chair  a mat is recommended   Next is TIME. Probably the most important and most difficult thing to plan for. However its essential to know when you plan to do the workouts in order to set yourself up for success. Ive chosen nap time. Im usually guaranteed at least one hour during the day when both kids are sleeping. If I dont get my full workout done in the time I finish it when my wonderful husband gets home from work  Alright now onto the workouts. Here is a breakdown of how Ive been doing with the workouts in the first 2 weeks as well as an idea of what they are like.    Core Synergistics  1 Hour   lots of push upsI modified with mostly girl push ups  great all over body workout  Most challenging move Dreya Roll   Cardio X  45 min   Usually I run but it rained really hard week 2 so I tried it out  A combination of the cardio portions of the following workouts yoga plyometrics kenpo and core  Love that it mixes it up constantly no repetitive moves  Worked up a great sweat by the end   ShoulderArms  1 Hour   circuit of shoulder bicep and tricep  new moves each time which is nice  intensity depends on the weight you choose  I need to start tracking next week my weightreps to see if I can improve from week to week   Ab Ripper X  16min twice a week   intense  definitely something that will improve over time  Most challenging move V Sit Up   Legs and Back  1 Hour   lots of pullups and squats  Im using the resistance band instead of pullups at this point  Hardest Move  One legged wall squat   Kenpo  1 Hour   amazing  full of cardio  lots of kicking and punching   Obviously this is just my personal perception of the workouts and their most difficult areas. It may be completely different for you And Im sure my view on these workoutswill evolve as the weeks go on and as I improve. But this is how I felt during the first 2 weeks of P90X. I challenged myself it was super hard work but it was well worth it because I feel amazing I cant wait to see what the next 2 weeks bring.           Pin It    Tweet                  httpwww.youtube.comwatchv63TnfgDEwsE       Pin It    Tweet          So as you can tell by the title I bit the bullet and started P90X  After weighing the pros and cons in my last blog I decided I had nothing to lose. I decided to do a test run this past week to make sure I felt it was an attainable goal before I shared the fact that I started with everyone else. And I happy to say it went awesome  Ok so it was definetly extremely hard work.Im not going to sugar coat it  It was tough And I wasnt able to do all the exercises. But considering its a 3 month long program I think that gives me more than enough time to work up to it. Im actually really proud by how much I can do. Dont get me wrong Im not at the pull up level yet but I think I did pretty damn good this past week And it feels amazing  Before I started the first workout I even got my husband to take some BEFORE pictures of mein a twopiece bathing suit gasp. Eww. Do you know how awful that is Haha. The only thing that can make you feel good about seeing your before pictures is if you have the AFTER pictures. Im really looking forward to the after because the before is not so pretty.  Ok so for those of you who were curious about what schedule Im following and the modifications Ive made here is my workout chart      Day 1  Day 2  Day 3  Day 4  Day 5  Day 6  Day 7    P90X Lean Phase 1    Week 13  Core Synergistics  Cardio X Running  ShouldersArms Ab Ripper X  Yoga X  LegsBack Ab Ripper X  Kenpo X  Rest or X Strech    Week 4  Yoga X  Core Synergistics  Kenpo X  X Strech  Cardio X Running  Yoga X  Rest or X Strech    P90X Lean Phase 2    Week 57  Core Synergistics  Cardio X Running  ChestShoulders Ab Ripper X  Yoga X  LegsBack Ab Ripper X  Kenpo X  Rest or X Strech    Week 8  Yoga X  Core Synergistics  Kenpo X  X Strech  Cardio X Running  Yoga X  Rest or X Strech    P90X Lean Phase 3    Week 911  ChestBack Ab Ripper X  Cardio X Running  ShouldersArms Ab Ripper X  Yoga X  Core Synergistics  Kenpo X  Rest or X Strech    Week 1012  ChestShoulders Ab Ripper X  Cardio X Running  BackBiceps Ab Ripper X  Yoga X  Core Synergistics  Kenpo X  Rest or X Strech    Week 13  Yoga X  Core Synergistics  Kenpo X  Yoga X  Cardio X Running  Yoga X  Rest or X Strech     I basically just replaced the cardio x sessions with a 5K run. I really enjoy running and wanted to keep it up so I figured it was a fair trade off.  I really hope this internal drive and motivation that Ive got going on keeps up. I dont like to start things I cant complete. So if it kills me I WILL do this And I hope my results are worth the effort        Pin It    Tweet          I have some weird quirks that Ive never really shared on my YouTube channel before. And its not even really because Imembarrassedby them. The topic has just not really ever come up. So I thought Id start with one today    I HATE lettuce.    Ok ok I know hate is a strong word. But I can definitely say its appropriate in this situation. A situation where if even the smallest bit of lettuce gets in my mouth I gag or even vomit. No joke. And everyone always says but lettuce doesnt have a taste. I beg to differ. For example  Im eating a subway sandwich. I like to put tomatoes pickles and olives on it. If even one tiny piece of shredded lettuce gets into my sub without me knowing and Im talking tiny my mouth will detect it and Ill have to spit it out. So if lettuce has no taste how are my taste buds picking up on it Hmph so there.    Anyways back to the main reason of this post my favourite salad If you are familiar with weight watchers youll know that fruits and veggies are zero points. Therefore I tend to eat lots to keep myself full. A salad is a great addition to lunch time because it adds bulk without using all my points. I do however think a salad of all veggies is rather boring. So mine has a few extras  I also like to prepare a super large salad for the week so its ready to go in the fridge. That way I dont have to chop everything up every time I want a salad.    Allisons No Lettuce Yummy Salad   3 English Cucumbers  peeled and cut into chunks  3 Tubs of Cherry Tomatoes or regular tomatoes  cut in half  12 Cup of Soy nuts  I like a crunch in my salad and soy nuts are pretty low points  3 oz light cheddar  cut in tiny chunks  5 tbsp of a light dressing  I like sundried tomato  Splash of white vinegar  for extra tang and to stretch out the dressing  Salt and Pepper to taste                     I combine all ingredients into one or two large storage containers and shake shake shake. Then its ready in my fridge for whenever I need it             I usually end up eating one large bowl of salad a day and at that rate the prepared amount lasts all week. Depending on how large the bowl is the points plus value is 2 or 3. Pretty awesome And very satisfying             Pin It    Tweet          Thanks for following our journey This was our second weighin recorded on Nov. 20th 2011. We talk a little bit more        Pin It    Tweet          Welcome to my blog  For those of you who dont know me my name is Allison and Ive been documenting my life on YouTube for the past 2 years. I really enjoy making videos and I plan to continue to do so however Ive recently been exposed to this whole blog world. I started by reading a couple of blogs by various YouTube mommies and now I feel like Im starting to figure it out and Im really enjoying it I think this will be a great addition to my YouTube hobby as I love to document our life and share things that are important to me and my family.    Allison Harrison Kayla 2 and Rylie 6 months  So why the name Hot Pink Momma  Well it starts with the fact that I hate my YouTube channel name allharr. Allharr AllisonHarrison. Why wont they let us change our channel names Grr. I created allharr simply to be able to comment on other peoples videos. I was solely a viewer with no intention to create my own videos. Well that all changed obviously. And now Im stuck with it Allharrnot sure how to even pronounce my own channel name Lol.  Anywaysso Ive come to terms that Im stuck with allharr on YouTube. But I got excited knowing I could pick a new blog name. Yay  Ok so heres my explanation behind the name  Hot  Well Im not so hot yet. But Im on a weight loss journey Soo maybe someday  Pink  My favourite colour Plus I have two girlies so I think pinks a given.  Momma  Clearly obvious  Hot Pink Momma  I LOVE IT Now if only I could change my YouTube name  Things you can expect to see on my blog include   Weight LossRelated Topics and Updates  Recipes  Family Updates  Product Reviews andGiveaways   And probably some random posts that just happen to be on my mind  Im excited to be able to send out an update without settingup my camera and brushing my hair My goal is to post one or twoentries a week asI slowly ease into the blog world.

,2222,P90X Lean Schedule Modified,,http://www.hotpinkmomma.com/?p=252,So as you can tell by the title I bit the bullet and started P90X  After weighing the pros and cons in my last blog I decided I had nothing to lose. I decided to do a test run this past week to make sure I felt it was an attainable goal before I shared the fact that I started with everyone else. And I happy to say it went awesome  Ok so it was definetly extremely hard work.Im not going to sugar coat it  It was tough And I wasnt able to do all the exercises. But considering its a 3 month long program I think that gives me more than enough time to work up to it. Im actually really proud by how much I can do. Dont get me wrong Im not at the pull up level yet but I think I did pretty damn good this past week And it feels amazing  Before I started the first workout I even got my husband to take some BEFORE pictures of mein a twopiece bathing suit gasp. Eww. Do you know how awful that is Haha. The only thing that can make you feel good about seeing your before pictures is if you have the AFTER pictures. Im really looking forward to the after because the before is not so pretty.  Ok so for those of you who were curious about what schedule Im following and the modifications Ive made here is my workout chart      Day 1  Day 2  Day 3  Day 4  Day 5  Day 6  Day 7    P90X Lean Phase 1    Week 13  Core Synergistics  Cardio X Running  ShouldersArms Ab Ripper X  Yoga X  LegsBack Ab Ripper X  Kenpo X  Rest or X Strech    Week 4  Yoga X  Core Synergistics  Kenpo X  X Strech  Cardio X Running  Yoga X  Rest or X Strech    P90X Lean Phase 2    Week 57  Core Synergistics  Cardio X Running  ChestShoulders Ab Ripper X  Yoga X  LegsBack Ab Ripper X  Kenpo X  Rest or X Strech    Week 8  Yoga X  Core Synergistics  Kenpo X  X Strech  Cardio X Running  Yoga X  Rest or X Strech    P90X Lean Phase 3    Week 911  ChestBack Ab Ripper X  Cardio X Running  ShouldersArms Ab Ripper X  Yoga X  Core Synergistics  Kenpo X  Rest or X Strech    Week 1012  ChestShoulders Ab Ripper X  Cardio X Running  BackBiceps Ab Ripper X  Yoga X  Core Synergistics  Kenpo X  Rest or X Strech    Week 13  Yoga X  Core Synergistics  Kenpo X  Yoga X  Cardio X Running  Yoga X  Rest or X Strech     I basically just replaced the cardio x sessions with a 5K run. I really enjoy running and wanted to keep it up so I figured it was a fair trade off.  I really hope this internal drive and motivation that Ive got going on keeps up. I dont like to start things I cant complete.

,2222,Posts tagged,,http://www.hotpinkmomma.com/?tag=p90x-weightloss-naptime,I started my weight loss journey 8 weeks ago and up to this point its consisted of weight watchers the elliptical and running. This combination has been working really well for me BUTI feel I need more. And its not even that Im plateauing because I havent yet yay. The p90x bug has gotten in my head and I cant shake it.    It all started with watching Kailins conclusion video of her p90x success story  httpwww.youtube.comwatchvbzkCNOAlln8 . I remember watching her do her weekly p90x videos thinking you go girl but thats something Ill never do. Granted I was pregnant at the time however it just seemed really intense. And now here I stand a year later contemplating it and shes the one who is pregnant Funny how that works..    So shes my inspiration for sure. But before I can commit to something so intense I really want to be sure that Im setting myself up for success. Im so worried that Ill start something and fail. Huge fear of mine Also the main reason why we delayed uploading the weightloss videos in the beginning. Not thats there anything terribly wrong with failing but I always try to be realistic with my goals to avoid disappointment. PLUSsince I share most of my life online failing publicly would be no fun at all.    For those of you who dont know what p90x is all about here is a brief synopsis   Its a multiple dvd workout program  1 to 1.5 Hours a day  6 days a week  13 weeks long  Pretty intense     So as you can see its a pretty big time commitment. Not something to consider lightly. Its a very intense 3 months in a row. Ok 3 months so if I start in January that takes me to the end of March. Well turns out thats actually the last 3 months I have on maternity leave. Maybe its meant to be Or maybe Ill regret devoting so much of my last remaining free time to it    Free time  FREE TIME    Dont you have 2 small children    Haha yes I do Which is a very time consuming and rewarding responsibility. The only free time and feasible time I can see to commit to this program is.NAP TIME. I obviously cant do an hour workout program while they are awake and when my husband gets home we are busy with dinner and baths and well life. And by the time they are in bed Im too exhausted. Sooo that leaves naptime. The one and only almost guaranteed time to myself I have during the day. Usually spanning between 100230pm.    I feel extremely fortunate that I am able to get this me time in a day. The fact that I can line up the naptimes of 2 small children is an accomplishment in itself. I usually eat lunch edit videos write blogs and RELAX in this time. Am I really prepared to give it up     Pros  Cons      P90x will help boost my weightloss  I will increase my strengthendurance  I will be extremely proud of myself  Iwillfeel great headingback to work  Iwill know Im working as hard as I can to lose the weight      I may feel more tiredstressed out because I lost naptime  I mightput too much pressure on myself  Less time to vlog and blog       Theres a lot to think about here but as it stands this moment I am leaning towards doing it. Since you guys know Ill share the journey with you onYouTubeand here as well I guess youll find out soon whether or not I do        Pin It    Tweet,,www.hotpinkmomma.com
,2222,Dairy Free Toddler Snacks,,http://www.hotpinkmomma.com/?p=421&replytocom=141,Recently Kayla has been having some pretty severe bottom rashes. We know she is lactose intolerant however we had become a bit slack with keeping all dairy out of her diet. In order to help combat the rash issuesweve become extremely strict in making sure she consumes no dairy. This has led me on a search for new ideas on snacks for her because she was getting bored with our typical routine. I thought Id share what Ive come up with in case its of value to anyone else out there with lactose intolerant toddlers. So here we go       raisins  pretzels  dried fruit  crackers  granola bars  fruit snacks  soy yogurt  ricesoy cheese  rice cakescrackers  fresh fruit and veggies      apple sauce  pita and hummus  peanut butter  quinoa  sliced meats  eggs  popcorn  smoothies  muffins       Kayla has been completely dairy free for 2 weeks now and we are unfortunately still having rash issues. Our doctor has finally agreed to allergy test her but her appointment is not for 6 months. In an effort to figure this out ourselves weve decided to eliminateallgluten products and see if that makes any difference. So if you have any gluten free toddler snack or meal ideas please share        Pin It    Tweet       Share this  Share   Facebook  Google 1  Twitter  Pinterest  Email,,www.hotpinkmomma.com

,2222,Dairy Free Toddler Snacks,,http://www.hotpinkmomma.com/?msg=fail&p=421%3Fshared%3Demail&replytocom=141,Recently Kayla has been having some pretty severe bottom rashes. We know she is lactose intolerant however we had become a bit slack with keeping all dairy out of her diet. In order to help combat the rash issuesweve become extremely strict in making sure she consumes no dairy. This has led me on a search for new ideas on snacks for her because she was getting bored with our typical routine. I thought Id share what Ive come up with in case its of value to anyone else out there with lactose intolerant toddlers. So here we go       raisins  pretzels  dried fruit  crackers  granola bars  fruit snacks  soy yogurt  ricesoy cheese  rice cakescrackers  fresh fruit and veggies      apple sauce  pita and hummus  peanut butter  quinoa  sliced meats  eggs  popcorn  smoothies  muffins       Kayla has been completely dairy free for 2 weeks now and we are unfortunately still having rash issues. Our doctor has finally agreed to allergy test her but her appointment is not for 6 months. In an effort to figure this out ourselves weve decided to eliminateallgluten products and see if that makes any difference. So if you have any gluten free toddler snack or meal ideas please share        Pin It    Tweet       Share this  Share   Facebook  Google 1  Twitter  Pinterest  Email,,www.hotpinkmomma.com

,2222,Naptime vs. P90X,,http://www.hotpinkmomma.com/?p=182,I started my weight loss journey 8 weeks ago and up to this point its consisted of weight watchers the elliptical and running. This combination has been working really well for me BUTI feel I need more. And its not even that Im plateauing because I havent yet yay. The p90x bug has gotten in my head and I cant shake it.    It all started with watching Kailins conclusion video of her p90x success story  httpwww.youtube.comwatchvbzkCNOAlln8 . I remember watching her do her weekly p90x videos thinking you go girl but thats something Ill never do. Granted I was pregnant at the time however it just seemed really intense. And now here I stand a year later contemplating it and shes the one who is pregnant Funny how that works..    So shes my inspiration for sure. But before I can commit to something so intense I really want to be sure that Im setting myself up for success. Im so worried that Ill start something and fail. Huge fear of mine Also the main reason why we delayed uploading the weightloss videos in the beginning. Not thats there anything terribly wrong with failing but I always try to be realistic with my goals to avoid disappointment. PLUSsince I share most of my life online failing publicly would be no fun at all.    For those of you who dont know what p90x is all about here is a brief synopsis   Its a multiple dvd workout program  1 to 1.5 Hours a day  6 days a week  13 weeks long  Pretty intense     So as you can see its a pretty big time commitment. Not something to consider lightly. Its a very intense 3 months in a row. Ok 3 months so if I start in January that takes me to the end of March. Well turns out thats actually the last 3 months I have on maternity leave. Maybe its meant to be Or maybe Ill regret devoting so much of my last remaining free time to it    Free time  FREE TIME    Dont you have 2 small children    Haha yes I do Which is a very time consuming and rewarding responsibility. The only free time and feasible time I can see to commit to this program is.NAP TIME. I obviously cant do an hour workout program while they are awake and when my husband gets home we are busy with dinner and baths and well life. And by the time they are in bed Im too exhausted. Sooo that leaves naptime. The one and only almost guaranteed time to myself I have during the day. Usually spanning between 100230pm.    I feel extremely fortunate that I am able to get this me time in a day. The fact that I can line up the naptimes of 2 small children is an accomplishment in itself. I usually eat lunch edit videos write blogs and RELAX in this time. Am I really prepared to give it up     Pros  Cons      P90x will help boost my weightloss  I will increase my strengthendurance  I will be extremely proud of myself  Iwillfeel great headingback to work  Iwill know Im working as hard as I can to lose the weight      I may feel more tiredstressed out because I lost naptime  I mightput too much pressure on myself  Less time to vlog and blog       Theres a lot to think about here but as it stands this moment I am leaning towards doing it.

,2222,Naptime vs. P90X,,http://www.hotpinkmomma.com/?p=182&replytocom=9,I started my weight loss journey 8 weeks ago and up to this point its consisted of weight watchers the elliptical and running. This combination has been working really well for me BUTI feel I need more. And its not even that Im plateauing because I havent yet yay. The p90x bug has gotten in my head and I cant shake it.    It all started with watching Kailins conclusion video of her p90x success story  httpwww.youtube.comwatchvbzkCNOAlln8 . I remember watching her do her weekly p90x videos thinking you go girl but thats something Ill never do. Granted I was pregnant at the time however it just seemed really intense. And now here I stand a year later contemplating it and shes the one who is pregnant Funny how that works..    So shes my inspiration for sure. But before I can commit to something so intense I really want to be sure that Im setting myself up for success. Im so worried that Ill start something and fail. Huge fear of mine Also the main reason why we delayed uploading the weightloss videos in the beginning. Not thats there anything terribly wrong with failing but I always try to be realistic with my goals to avoid disappointment. PLUSsince I share most of my life online failing publicly would be no fun at all.    For those of you who dont know what p90x is all about here is a brief synopsis   Its a multiple dvd workout program  1 to 1.5 Hours a day  6 days a week  13 weeks long  Pretty intense     So as you can see its a pretty big time commitment. Not something to consider lightly. Its a very intense 3 months in a row. Ok 3 months so if I start in January that takes me to the end of March. Well turns out thats actually the last 3 months I have on maternity leave. Maybe its meant to be Or maybe Ill regret devoting so much of my last remaining free time to it    Free time  FREE TIME    Dont you have 2 small children    Haha yes I do Which is a very time consuming and rewarding responsibility. The only free time and feasible time I can see to commit to this program is.NAP TIME. I obviously cant do an hour workout program while they are awake and when my husband gets home we are busy with dinner and baths and well life. And by the time they are in bed Im too exhausted. Sooo that leaves naptime. The one and only almost guaranteed time to myself I have during the day. Usually spanning between 100230pm.    I feel extremely fortunate that I am able to get this me time in a day. The fact that I can line up the naptimes of 2 small children is an accomplishment in itself. I usually eat lunch edit videos write blogs and RELAX in this time. Am I really prepared to give it up     Pros  Cons      P90x will help boost my weightloss  I will increase my strengthendurance  I will be extremely proud of myself  Iwillfeel great headingback to work  Iwill know Im working as hard as I can to lose the weight      I may feel more tiredstressed out because I lost naptime  I mightput too much pressure on myself  Less time to vlog and blog       Theres a lot to think about here but as it stands this moment I am leaning towards doing it.
